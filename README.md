# Jessica's React Portfolio

## Description

I was given the task of building a personal portfolio to showcase my recent projects. Having a portfolio is a neccessity not only for potential employers or for working as a freelancer, but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects. The main requirement of the project was to use React + Vite along with React Router Dom to help set myself apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies. The portfolio should also include the following:

- A single Header component that appears on multiple pages

- A single Navigation component within the header that will be used to render the different sections of your portfolio

- A single Project component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section

- A single Footer component that appears on multiple pages

## Table of Contents

- [Description](#description)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [Contact Info](#contact-info)
- [License](#license)

## Usage

This application has been deployed through Netlify, so you may simply click on the included link. You will be presented with the About Me page with with a short bio. In the Navigation bar just click on "Portfolio" to be taken to a page with six deployed applications complete with an image, description, live link, and link to the GitHub repository. You may then click on the "Contact Me" link to be taken to a contact form to type your name, e-mail and a message. The back-end functionality has not yet been implemented for the form. Finally, click the "Resume" link to be taken to a page with a list of my front-end and back-end proficiences listed. There is also a button for the link to my future resume. Notice that on each page that is rendered, the header with navigation bar along with the footer with multiple social media links persist.
